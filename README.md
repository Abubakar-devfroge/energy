# Energy Auditing Prototype

A prototype **Energy Auditing System** built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).  
Upload your energy data via a form, let the system analyze it, perform an audit, and get actionable suggestions to optimize energy usage.
In its final form the manual upload will be replaced by data input from sensors
